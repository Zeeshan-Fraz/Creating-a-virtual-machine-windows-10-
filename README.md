<h2>Objectives</h2>

In this part of the project I created a windows 10 virtual machine in Azure

I will also show the changes that I mad to getting the virtual machine setup, as I needed to open the RDP port 3389 on the machine in order for threar actors to be able to 
remotely connect/brute force acces to the virtal machine.

I createed a virtual machine with windows 10 OS as my chosen OS with the standard desik size and with an admin account.
(I left the disk size as the default as the higher the size the more credit consumption for the azure trail subscription)

I also left the inbound ports as default, to allowing connections from port 3389 RDP.

Once I was happy with the disk size, I clicked on the Next Diks button to configuring the disks on the virtal machine
