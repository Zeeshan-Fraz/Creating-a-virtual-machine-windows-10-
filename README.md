<h2>Objectives</h2>

In this part of the project I created a windows 10 virtual machine in Azure

I will also show the changes that I mad to getting the virtual machine setup, as I needed to open the RDP port 3389 on the machine in order for threar actors to be able to 
remotely connect/brute force acces to the virtal machine.
